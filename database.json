      "title": "You Will Make This No-Boil Overnight Mac &amp; Cheese Again And Again - WorldNewsEra",
      "text": "I am a big Ina Garten fan. Her food is simple to prepare and delicious. I love her approach to entertaining and how she incorporates international flair into her cozy comfort food. When I got her new cookbook, “Go-to Dinners,” I browsed through it and the “Overnight Mac & Cheese” caught my eye. Without reading the recipe, I envisioned a mac & cheese like an egg strata where you soak the raw pasta overnight and bake it the next day. Ina’s recipe is a little different than what I thought it was going to be, and calls for par-boiling the pasta. I don’t know why, but I find par-boiling pasta for baked casseroles like lasagna and mac & cheese to be something that I don’t want to do. I’ve made a no-boil spinach lasagna for as long as I can remember, and Ina’s recipe inspired me to do the same for mac & cheese. I used my “no-boil” baking technique—covering the casserole with heavy-duty foil to keep the steam in and cook the pasta—with the ingredients and proportions in Ina’s recipe. I mixed pasta, heavy cream, grated cheese and seasonings together and let it sit overnight. The next day, I baked it at 400°F as her recipe instructs, and it was good. The only problem was that the fat separated out when it was baked at that temperature, and the top of the dish had pools of oil on it. This won’t bother some people and the breadcrumbs soaked it up, but I wondered if the recipe would work with milk instead of cream. I tried it with both 2% and whole milk. The 2% version was a little too light for me, but if you don’t like the richness of whole milk, you should try it with 2%. After experimenting with different combinations of milk and cheese, I settled on a recipe made with shell pasta, whole milk, sharp cheddar and a cheesy top instead of breadcrumbs. If you want to make it a little richer, you can sub a cup of cream for one of the cups of whole milk. The beauty of this recipe is that it is more of a technique than a recipe and you can adapt it to suit your taste. I added Dijon mustard and fresh grated nutmeg to my recipe, but if you don’t like either of those, you can use your favorite spices. I personally think the nutmeg is key and would keep that with everything except a spicy jalapeño version of the recipe. You may want to ask, is it as creamy as when you make a cheese sauce? No, it is not. But the result is so good that I will never make mac & cheese any other way. The fact that you can make homemade mac & cheese with about 2 minutes of hands-on prep time is a compromise that is worth it for me. All the ingredients are easy-to-find, and convenient. Because the milk, cheese and pasta sits overnight, this is one recipe where the pre-grated cheese from the grocery store works even better than hand-grated cheese. Plus this recipe can be customized with any of your favorite cheeses and you can add your favorite mix-ins as well. Think sautéed wild mushrooms, cauliflower, Butternut squash, bacon, ham, etc., If you add a frozen vegetable “mix-in” like chunks of Butternut squash, you need to add it frozen to the overnight mixture just before you bake it. It will also add about 25 minutes to the total cooking time, but it is so worth it. This week, I made it and used a mixture of Gruyere, swiss and cheddar with a layer of the squash in the middle. I made my overnight mix, and let it sit covered in a bowl in the refrigerator for a full day. When I was ready to bake it, I coated a 7 x 11 casserole dish with olive oil, poured half the mixture into the pan and added a layer of frozen chunked Butternut squash before pouring the rest of the overnight mixture on top. I covered the dish with heavy-duty foil and baked it at 375°F for a little more than an hour. After an hour or so, the pasta should be cooked al dente and the squash is no longer hard. If it isn’t, put the foil back on and bake for another 15 minutes. Once it is at the al dente stage, remove the foil and put the casserole back in the oven until it is begins to brown along the edges, about 10 minutes. At this point, add a layer of sharp cheddar—or your favorite cheese—to the top. Back in the oven it goes until it is GBD—Golden. Brown. Delicious—and then it’s time to dig in. No-Boil Overnight Mac & Cheese Now that I’ve made this easy Mac ‘n’ Cheese, I don’t think I’ll ever make it any other way. It isn’t as creamy as a cheese sauce, but it scratches the cheesy mac itch. With this base recipe, you can customize it with all your favorite versions of mac & cheese by adding your favorite seasonings, mix-ins and cheeses. Most importantly, you can make it anytime you have about 2 minutes seconds to stir it together, and you are patient enough to let it sit overnight in the refrigerator! Serves 6 Ingredients: 3 ½ cups whole milk*, divided 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard 12 ounces shredded sharp cheddar cheese—you can mix up the cheese—divided ¼ teaspoon fresh-grated nutmeg ½ teaspoon fine-grain sea salt ¼ teaspoon white pepper 8 ounces dried pasta, such as mini Penne or shells Olive oil * if you want it to be a little richer, substitute a cup or so of cream or half and half for the milk Method: 1. Pour ½ cup of milk in the bottom of a mixing bowl. Mix in the mustard until you no longer see any clumps of mustard. Add the rest of the milk and mix. Mix well and add the nutmeg, salt and pepper. 2. Add a generous 2 cups of the grated cheese and reserve the rest for the top when you bake the Mac & Cheese. Add the dry pasta and mix again. Set aside. 3. Coat the bottom of an 8” x 8” or 7” x 11” casserole dish with olive oil—only use enough to coat the bottom or the extra will float to the top once you add the pasta-milk mixture. 4. Pour the mixture into the dish and make sure all the pasta is submerged. If not, add a little more milk. It will absorb the liquid and expand. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Store in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Note: If adding a “mix-in” like frozen cubed Butternut squash to the dish, let the pasta-milk-cheese mixture sit overnight in a bowl as you need to add the frozen vegetable just before baking. When ready to bake, follow the instructions in step 3 and 4, adding the “mix-in.” to the casserole. 5. When ready to bake: Preheat the oven to 375°F. 6. Bake the casserole covered with the aluminum foil for about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. Check to make sure that the pasta is cooked and the cheese is melted and bubbling. It should be brown around the edges. 7. When you think the Mac & Cheese is almost done, remove the foil and let it bake for 10 minutes. 8. Remove from oven and sprinkle the reserved cheese on top. Bake for about 10 more minutes or until the cheese is lightly brown and slightly crusty. Let sit 5 to 10 minutes before serving.",

      "title": "65 Healthy Meals for Weight Loss to Make on Busy Weeknights",
      "text": "A common misconception among people who are trying to lose weight is that it’s fine to skip a meal (or simply not eat enough) because it’ll help you operate at a calorie deficit, which in turn will help you see faster results. This is categorically false. Regardless of whether or not you’re trying to shed pounds, it’s crucial that you give your body the calories and nutrients it needs in order to function and feel its best. But the busier life gets, the harder it can be to make sure you’re not only eating all of your meals but also consuming food that is healthy and nutritious on a consistent basis. If you have trouble finding the time and energy to make dinner on busy weeknights, read on to get inspired with 65 easy, healthy meals that will support your weight loss goals. How To Make Healthy Weight Loss Dinners According to Dr. Lisa R. Young, Ph.D., RDN, author of Finally Full, Finally Slim and The Portion Teller Plan, there are several guidelines you should follow to keep your weight loss goals on track when it comes to preparing a healthy dinner: Try to fill half your plate with colorful vegetables. Include your favorite non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, red pepper, and/or Bok choy. Include healthy proteins such as fish, chicken, beans, tofu, tempeh, and eggs. This should be 1/4 of the plate. Grill or bake your fish or chicken instead of frying it. Include a healthy starch for 1/4 of your plate, such as sweet potato, brown rice, quinoa, kasha, farro, or a baked potato. Limit white flour and practice portion control—you can still include some starch and lose weight, just don’t eat too much of it. Now that you have a better understanding of some of the ways you can make a healthy dinner on even your busiest nights, check out some of these recipes for inspiration. Total time: ~30 minutes For those nights when you’re craving a burger, a chicken burger can be an easy (but still delicious) alternative with far less saturated fat than a beef burger. This healthy dinner recipe is ideal because it can be made in 30 minutes or less. You’ll have a protein-rich, lower-fat meal on busy nights and you’ll still be satisfied.

      "title": "The Echelon Row-S Smart Rower offers a total body workout that never gets boring",
      "text": "No longer the overlooked machine next to the treadmill and elliptical at the gym, the steadfast rowing machine is having a renaissance. With the proliferation of sleeker, connected rowers designed for working out at home, more and more people are discovering the powerful, total body workout that is rowing. One of these at-home options is the Echelon Row-S Smart Rowing Machine, which at $1,599, is considerably less expensive than other popular rowers on the market (including the Aviron Rower; $2,199, Peloton Row; $3,195 and the Hydrow; $2,495). Like its pricier brethren (and most home gym alternatives these days), the Echelon Row-S requires a paid subscription to access the full library of on-demand classes in multiple formats, as well as daily live workouts and scenic rows to keep things interesting. And, you can rotate the screen to incorporate any of its numerous floor workouts to your routine. The required Premier Membership is $35 per month, though you have the option to pay for one or two years at a time, which drops it to $33 and $29 per month, respectively. If you’re looking for a more reasonable entry into the world of rowing, here’s what you should know before you invest in an Echelon Row-S. What we liked about it The design The Echelon Row-S is thoughtfully designed. The rowing is smooth and silent (both the movement of the seat up and down the slide and the band that glides in and out of the flywheel as you row) and the cushioned seat is extra comfortable. My favorite part is the buttons in the middle of the handlebar that allow you to simply and easily adjust the resistance (which goes from 1 to 32). As a former college rower, this makes it more fun and interactive, and less like the ergometers I remember — my heart rate spiking rapidly and the urging of the coxswain in my ear to go faster. The rotating HD touchscreen makes the experience more fun as well. It’s 22 inches wide, just 2 inches smaller than the Peloton Row and the same size as the Hydrow. The entire rower also has a relatively small footprint at 7 x 2.15 feet, with wheels on the front end for simple maneuvering — and it weighs in at 114.5 pounds. With wheels on the front end, it’s easy to maneuver. I especially like its foldable design, which makes it easy to store out of the way. This final aspect is quite clever, as the slide portion of the rower folds up so that the machine can stand on its own — no leaning or securing it to the wall necessary. The variety of workouts For people who are new to rowing, there is a series of short Beginner Row classes that focus on form and how to row properly while also offering a taste of some of the different class formats. But even in the longer, more advanced classes, almost all the instructors will review proper rowing form during the warmup — some even do drills breaking down the stroke — to ensure you’re rowing correctly. Since proper form is so critical to avoiding injury and getting the most out of your rowing workout, the constant reminders are a big plus. Echelon recently released their winter schedule of live rowing classes and it features 30 live classes every week, which comes to about two to eight per day. Most of the classes are 20 or 30 minutes long, but there are some 45-minute classes in the on-demand library (which currently has over 3,600 classes) for the more hardcore rowers. Among these are speed rows, which focus on sprinting; endurance rows, which focus on maintaining a steady pace; and fusion rows, which are a combination of speed, endurance and power. A Fusion 30 is the perfect one stop workout if you are looking to burn out your muscles as well as get some cardio. I also love the Bootcamp classes, which focus on total body, core, upper body or lower body, and are a combination of rowing and floor exercises with or without free weights. In addition to rowing workouts, the Premier Membership gives you access to FitPass, the extensive library of nearly 6,000 live and on demand floor classes that include formats like strength training, boxing, yoga, Pilates and stretching. The strength classes feature creative and challenging mixes of exercises, are mostly 10 or 20 minutes long and meant to be stacked; I like to start with a 10-minute HIIT class to get my heart rate up, followed by 20 minutes of total body strength. In the on demand library, classes like Boxing Bootcamp and HIIT and Core offer stellar full-body workouts in just 30 minutes. The instructors are supportive and inspiring across all exercise formats. While some are all about the workout — and for good reason, as their classes are challenging — others bring a bit more personality and ease while keeping the workouts tough. Like the one that tells a dad joke in every class while flaunting her super aspirational arms, obliques and fashion sense, and another that offers peeks into her home life while holding a plank for much longer than I can. What we didn’t like about it Some interface issues Echelon has a companion app that looks exactly the same as what you see on the screen on the rower, which I appreciate. Once you complete a workout, row or otherwise, it goes under My Workouts on your Progress screen. But once there, the date on the workout changes from the day it aired to the day you completed it. If you like saving your favorite workouts to go back to more than once, you can star a class and it will appear in your Favorites section on the Featured screen. Personally, I don’t like repeating workouts, so there’s no way for me to tell which classes I’ve done in order to avoid them—unless I were to star every class as I go and use that Favorites tag as a tell to choose a different class. If you want to search for a rowing class taught by your favorite instructor, you can type in their name. But if you want to use any other search filters — which include type of workout, length, and genre of music — there are over 100 instructors to scroll through, many of which don’t even teach rowing. Finally, during classes you have the ability to change the metric that’s the largest on your screen, either output, resistance, or cadence, depending on the type of workout or what you want to focus on. That’s great for the individual, but I have heard instructors reference a metric on my screen that is not where they say it is. That said, these are minor nuisances that don’t detract from the quality of the workout. The music While not an absolute must, I do love when the music I’m working out to helps me find that next gear or pushes me to reach a new best. Unfortunately, that has not been my experience with Echelon. Playlists typically feature workout or dance remixes of songs and a lot of music released in the late 2000s and early 2010s — so if that’s not your bag, you’re out of luck. Meanwhile, some instructors will use the same songs a lot, which can get repetitive. How it compares The Row-S isn’t Echelon’s only rower; the company also sells the Row ($1,000), which instead of an attached screen has a built-in holder for your smartphone or tablet. The handlebars are also shaped differently than the “competition-style handlebars” on the Row-S. The Echelon Row-S is similar to home rowing machines like the Hydrow ($2,495), NordicTrack RW900 ($1,799) and Peloton Row ($3,195). The only feature the Echelon Row-S lacks that both the Hydrow and NordicTrack rowers do have are classes taught by instructors rowing on the water, while the Peloton Row offers real-time feedback on form. But what makes Echelon so special is the fact that it offers machines of equal quality at more affordable, and therefore more accessible, price points. This is true across all of their equipment — they also make connected bikes, treadmills and fitness mirrors — with each modality available at two or more different prices in order to make a first-rate fitness experience available to a wider range of people who want it. Bottom line Research shows that rowing engages over 85% of your muscles at the same time, a workout experience that’s worth an investment in a quality machine. The Echelon Row-S offers that type of quality without breaking the bank. The varied rowing workouts are challenging and fun, the rower itself is thoughtfully designed and the instructors are engaging and inspiring — though it could be easier to search for them. With so many floor classes included with your membership, it also allows you to change up your exercise format on a daily or weekly basis if you want.

But exercising on an empty stomach isn’t the ideal way to go if you want to be able to reap the benefits from your gym session. Nor is a full-on fry up that’ll leave you feeling queasy on the treadmill. Fitness and nutrition expert Patrick Dale from Fitness Volt has revealed a useful guide on what to eat to fuel your morning workouts and maximize early morning energy. And we have to say, the suggestions look tasty enough to convince those of us struggling to become morning workout people. So long as your meal contains moderate to high carbs and a source of protein, it will provide your body with what it needs to power through, Patrick says, even if those foods are not traditional breakfast foods. Some good examples are ripe banana mashed onto toast with a little honey or cereal and low-fat milk. A fruit smoothie made with soft fruit, low-fat yogurt, and protein powder is also a good option.

Ideally, you should consume your early morning training meal 30-60 minutes before you start training, says Patrick, as this will give the food long enough to start digesting. Make sure to save time by planning and preparing your morning workout meal the night before. Also, liquids digest more quickly than solids, so if you plan to train shortly after getting up, it may be better to drink rather than eat your pre-workout meal. Granola bars are another great option before going to the gym (Picture: Getty Images/Westend61) Pro tip: Make sure what you eat the night before is also a pre-workout meal Even a great pre-early morning workout meal will not make up for not eating correctly the night before. Patrick advises eating a nutritionally complete meal a few hours before bed will help fuel muscle recovery and growth and ensure you wake up with good levels of muscle glycogen. Your early morning pre-workout snack should top up your already high levels of glycogen and glucose. Carbohydrates When you eat carbohydrates, they are broken down into glucose which acts as an immediate source of energy, and any surplus is converted to and then stored as glycogen. As glucose and glycogen are needed to power you through your workout, carbohydrates should be the cornerstone of your pre-early morning workout meal. Because there will not be much time between getting up and starting your workout, you need fast-acting and easy to digest carbs. This means you should choose foods that rank moderate to high on the glycaemic index chart. The glycaemic index chart ranks carbs from 1-100, with 100 being the fastest acting. Moderate to high glycaemic carbs are digested easily and raise your blood glucose quickly. Protein helps prevent muscle breakdown (Picture: Getty Images) Moderate to high GI foods: Dates Breakfast cereal White bread Ripe bananas White rice Protein While you can just eat carbs before training, some research suggests combining carbs with protein will have an even better effect, explains Patrick. Consuming carbs with protein provides energy and can also help prevent muscle breakdown. Avoid fatty foods Fat is the most significant gastric inhibitor, which keeps food in your stomach for longer and delays digestion. As such, your pre-early morning workout meal should be very low in fat, not even healthy fats such as olive oil, flaxseed oil, or coconut oil. Also, avoid natural sources of fats, such as nuts and whole eggs. Low fibre-foods Fibre is part of most carbohydrate foods. However, while fibre is very good for you, like fat, it is also a major gastric inhibitor and best avoided in pre-early morning workout meals. Instead, Patrick says we should look for more refined and naturally low-fibre foods, such as white bread instead of whole-grain bread. Do you have a story to share?
